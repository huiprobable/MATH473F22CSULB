# MATH473F22CSULB

MATH 473 - Scientific Computing, Fall 2022

California State University -- Long Beach

The content of this course is based on these two websites: [Python for Scientific Computing](https://aaltoscicomp.github.io/python-for-scicomp/) and [Python Numerial Methods](https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/index.html). The course is taught in Python with Jupyter Notebooks, using libraries such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlab, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. In this course, we will learn to implement algorithms and use existing packages to solve numerical linear algebra problems. We will also learn to process, analyze, and visualize data. 

Throughout the semester, I will be using Jupyter Notebook to write most of my lecture notes and coding; while sometimes handwriting some mathematical derivations using notability. Meanwhile, I will record all my lecture videos. All the notability notes, jupyter notebook notes, and lecture videos will be linked under the Course Content below.
