    "\n",
    "In this class, we will learn to use Python and various modules of Python, through examples and documentations. We will also learn to use Python for data analysis, processing, and visualization. Furthermore, we will learn various topics related to scientific computing and their implementations in Python. Examples may include optimization, matrix factorization, numerical integration, numerial differentiation, and iterative methods for sparse linear systems.  \n",

    "### Accommodation and Technical Help:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have disability and need some special accommodation, you need to visit Bob Murphy Access Center (BMAC) [https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/](https://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/dss/). It is your responsibility to notify me, in advance, of your need for the accommodation of a disability that has been verified by the University.\n",
    "2. If you do not have a laptop or only have poor internet access, you may check out CSULB’s announce- ment regarding supplying you with laptops and internet hotspots. Please see the webpage linked here: [https://www.csulb.edu/news/article/csulb-to-supply-laptops-and-internet-hotspots-for-students? fbclid=IwAR3Kd8A1UpGn80XI1ZscYl9SCLCF4IY-D4CSwAosfRx8iJanAMtDoBEgLCo](https://www.csulb.edu/news/article/csulb-to-supply-laptops-and-internet-hotspots-for-students?fbclid=IwAR3Kd8A1UpGn80XI1ZscYl9SCLCF4IY-D4CSwAosfRx8iJanAMtDoBEgLCo).\n",
    "3. If you need help on Beachboard, Zoom, or other technical area related to online learning, you may seek help from Academic Technology Services. Here is their website: [https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services](https://www.csulb.edu/academic-technology-services). You may find the Keep Learning module in this website helpful.

    "### Dropping or Withdrawal:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you intend to drop (within first two weeks) or withdraw (week 3-12) from the class, you may follow the guideline in this website [https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/dropping-and-withdrawing](https://www.csulb.edu/student-records/dropping-and-withdrawing). It is your responsibility to withdraw officially from classes. Instructors have no obligation to withdraw students who do not attend courses, and may choose not to do so. You should also consult the CSULB Enrollment Services website for registration information: [http://www.csulb.edu/depts/enrollment/summer/calendar.html](http://www.csulb.edu/depts/enrollment/summer/calendar.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attendance and Missed Assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "Students are required to attend every class. However, attendance and participation will not be used in grade determination. It is the student’s responsibility to keep informed of any announcements, syllabus adjustments, or policy changes made during scheduled classes. If you miss the deadline of one due material, you may make it up or turn it in late, but you need to provide legitimate reasons. Otherwise, the instructor may not accept the late material or may deduct partial credits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cheating and Plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Although students are encouraged to work together on the lab assignments, the work you turn in must be products of your own intellectual activity. The quizzes are all open book, open notes, but you may not ask someone to do the work for you, and you are not allowed to discuss with each other solutions to quiz problems. Cheating and plagiarism are serious academic offenses. Please read the section on cheating and plagiarism in the CSULB Catalog. [http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/aa/catalog/2016-2017/academic_information/cheating_plagiarism.html](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/aa/catalog/2016-2017/academic_information/cheating_plagiarism.html)\n",

    "### Policy on Sexual Misconduct\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNSM is committed to providing a safe and positive learning environment and has established a zero- tolerance policy for any sexual/gender-based misconduct, including, but not limited to sexual harassment, assault, dating violence or stalking for all faculty, staff, and students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following entities at CSULB have been established to provide support and assistance for victims of sexual harassment and assault: Equity & Diversity for Title IX needs [http://www.csulb.edu/equity-diversity/title-ix](http://www.csulb.edu/equity-diversity/title-ix); CSULB University Police Department [https://www.csulb.edu/university-police/title-ix](https://www.csulb.edu/university-police/title-ix); The Women’s & Gender Equity Center [http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/wrc/sexual_assault/](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/wrc/sexual_assault/); and the Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) Office [http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/caps/](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/caps/); and Student Health Services [http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/shs/sexual_assault.htm](http://web.csulb.edu/divisions/students/shs/sexual_assault.htm).
